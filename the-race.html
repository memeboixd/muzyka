<p class="txt">Zarowno piosenka jak i teledysk do niej stworzony zostal stworzony podczas, gdy raper byl poszukiwany przez policje. Jak mozemy zauwazyc w jednej z pierwszych scen teledysku wykonawca stoi kolo swojego listu gonczego. </p>

<p class="txt">Taymor Travon McIntyre (born June 16, 2000), known professionally as Tay-K, is an American rapper, songwriter and convicted murderer. He is best known for his hit song "The Race", which reached number 44 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 2018. The song went viral following his arrest in Elizabeth, New Jersey, after a nationwide manhunt for murder.

    McIntyre was captured by U.S. marshals on June 30, 2017, the same day "The Race" was released, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, after a total of three months on the run. After being extradited back to Texas for his crimes, McIntyre started to receive support from his fans on social media.[5] While being held at Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth, Texas, Tay-K's management team released his debut mixtape, Santana World, on July 29, 2017, and it received a generally positive response from critics and fans. On March 19, 2018, his song "Hard", featuring Blocboy JB, was released via hip hop-oriented record label No Jumper Records. In July 2019, McIntyre was found guilty of murder for his involvement in the 2016 home invasion and robbery that left 21-year-old Ethan Walker dead, and was sentenced to 55 years in prison. In November 2019, McIntyre was indicted on a second murder charge for allegedly shooting 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar, and was awaiting trial.</p>
