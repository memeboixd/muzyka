He is a member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob, from which he adopted his moniker.

    Rocky released his debut mixtape Live. Love. A$AP, in 2011 to critical acclaim. The success of his mixtape led to a record deal with Polo Grounds Music, RCA Records, and Sony Music Entertainment. He subsequently recorded his 2013 debut studio album Long. Live. A$AP, which was also well received by critics and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. In 2015, Rocky released his second studio album titled At. Long. Last. A$AP. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making it Rocky's second consecutive album to debut at number one and has received positive reviews from music critics.

    Fucking with the wrong man<br>

    I guess you fell into the wrong hands, yeah<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    And now you're F-in' with the wrong man, man<br>
    Ah ah ah ah ah<br>
    You took some time away from me<br>
    I see you made your mind<br>
    Just read the signs, it's clear to see<br>
    I'm tryna make you mine<br>
    'Cause love is blind, your hurt is fine<br>
    To heal, it takes some time<br>
    I guess you fell into the wrong hands, yeah<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    And now you're F-in' with the wrong man, man<br>
    Ah ah ah ah ah<br>

    Ooh, ah ah ah ah ah<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh, ah ah ah ah ah<br>
    Tokyo trips, shopping sprees full of gifts<br>
    I remember we would dream about kids<br>

    Back when you used to be's with that Crip<br>
    Gotta give a little to get<br>
    A little bit in return now, tables turn now<br>
    And you heard 'bout me and my bitch<br>
    I'm just tryna chill<br>
    'Cause lately I've been thinking 'bout you and rebuilding<br>
    Walking 'round like you lost feelings<br>
    I can tell he not fulfilling<br>
    You in love with me still<br>
    They say only if looks could kill, for real<br>
    You walk around town with that guy<br>
    When you pass by (ah ah)<br>
    I just laugh like (ah ah)<br>
    I guess you fell into the wrong hands, yeah<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    And now you're F-in' with the wrong man, man<br>
    Ah ah ah ah ah<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh, ah ah ah ah ah<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
    Ooh, ah ah ah ah ah<br>
